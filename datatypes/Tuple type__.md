Tuple type**

**Tuple type**

Tuples is just like a list but with parenthesis

e.g 

```
temperatues = (12.3, 23.5, 31)
```

The real difference between list and tuples are

- list are mutable
- tuples are immutable

tuples are faster than list

examples - 

```
list.append(1) will work fine

tuple.append(1) will not work, there are no such function that can mutate the tuple
```

Same as list, tuples can also be nested
