Dictionary type**

**Dictionary type**

Dictionay(dict) type is same as hash in other programming languages

It stores key value pairs

e.g

```
grades = {
  'user1': 10,
  'user2': 6.7
}
```

To get the values you can user

```
grades = {'user1': 10,'user2': 6.7}
print(grades.values())

output - dict_values([10, 6.7])
```

Output looks like a list but its not exactly a list but works like a list

To ge the keys just use `.keys()` function
