1. Python got his name not from the snake, but from Monty Python's Flying Circus, a favorite comedy series of Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python.

2. Did you know that Python was first released in 1991? Python 2 was released in 2000, and Python 3 (the current version) in 2008.

3. Python is mainly used for automation purposes, web apps, and data science. Many big companies, like Instagram, Facebook, and Amazon, use Python in different parts of their products. For example, Facebook uses Python to process images.

4. Python comes pre-installed on Linux and Mac operating systems. In May 2019, Windows 10 also launched an update that also has Python pre-installed. That is an added endorsement for Python.
